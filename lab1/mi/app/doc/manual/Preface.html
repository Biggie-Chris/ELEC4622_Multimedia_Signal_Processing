</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=3><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Media Interface system has been evolving to its current state over a period of nearly two years.  This manual describes version 3.0, which is the first version to abandon backward compatibility with previous versions in order to enforce a rigorous object model whose interfaces isolate individual processing modules and applications (at the binary, not just the source code level) from changes and extensions in the underlying implementations, as well as the structure of the interfaces themselves.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The primary goal of the Media Interface system is to enable independently developed, tested and compiled processing modules to be used and reused in the development and deployment of complex multi-media processing systems.  In order to achieve such a goal, we make every endeavour to ensure that processing modules are independent of one another as well as the particular implementation of the Media Interface library against which they were originally compiled.  Independence from one another implies that the system itself manages and optimises memory resources, thread synchronisation and other system-wide issues which alternative approaches such as Microsoft’s Active Movie leave to the individual  module developers.  This goal also leads naturally to a new paradigm, known as <I>description-based processing</I>, which is central to the way in which modules interact within the Media Interface framework.  At the same time, in designing the Media Interface system, a parallel goal was to provide as simple a path as possible for converting existing code into Media Interface modules, with an emphasis on the programming styles and assumptions commonly used by research engineers and scientists in their experimental implementations.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The term, &quot;multi-media&quot;, is rather vague and it is worth emphasising here that the Media Interface system addresses the problems typically encountered in any application which involves complex processing of large, potentially unbounded quantities of data, which possesses a natural partial-ordering property.  This certainly includes applications involving the obvious media streams of audio, video, images and text.  However, it also includes such applications as rendering from a stream of printer control tokens, which is currently performed by the large and often cumbersome software and firmware systems embedded within hardcopy devices.  Thus, the term &quot;Media&quot; in the name &quot;Media Interface&quot;, refers to its applicability whenever large, potentially unbounded quantities of partially ordered data must be processed.  The term, &quot;Interface&quot;, in the name of this system refers to the fact that the interaction between processing modules and between such modules and the Media Interface system itself all takes place across well-defined object interfaces, whose stability is guaranteed in the face of implementation changes, as well as changes in the structure of the interfaces themselves, without any requirement for recompilation.  These interfaces also allow modules written in different programming languages to interact with one another and even extend each other’s functionality in a transparent manner.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Media Interface documentation is organised into several components.  Chapter 0 of this manual provides an initial overview of the Media Interface system, presenting the most fundamental concepts and philosophical principles at an elementary level.  Following this, Chapter I provides examples, programming techniques and usage tips which should be sufficient to allow readers to start using the system as soon as possible.  Of course, many questions will inevitably arise with the need to go beyond the simple examples presented in Chapter I; to answer these,  Chapter III carefully expounds the core concepts and paradigms embodied by the Media Interface system.  Finally, the Media Interface installation package comes with more than 700 pages of extensively hyper-linked HTML documentation which details all standard object interfaces and the role they play in realising core Media Interface paradigms; moreover, this on-line documentation automatically grows to incorporate extensions and entirely new object interfaces defined by any interested party.</P></DIR>
